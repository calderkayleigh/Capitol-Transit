# Capitol Transit
Limitations: users cannot connect between different metro lines (ie taking a blue then transfering to red at a station). We developed a prototype algorithm with the help of OpenStack which worked, but hardcoding each station/its connections proved to be very time consuming. Additionally, buses are seperate from the rail page.

# CSCI 4237 - Project 2 - BYOI
Note: you can only do single line travel in the current code. Working on developing a shortest path algorithm to determine how to get from line to line. This algoritnm is shown in the java file. 

**Some Sample Data to Use:** 
Start Address: 1221 S Eads Street Arlington, VA 22202 
End Address: 1812 N Quinn Street Arlington, VA 22202

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Create a new folder inside of your cloned repo (e.g. like "Project1").
3. Create a new Android Studio project (min SDK version of API 23). During the initial project setup, set the Save location to the new folder that you just created (e.g. so you can commit your project back into this repo).
  - **If you are extending Project 1**, you can instead copy your project files into this repo and push them up. You'll need to do this if working in pairs so your partner can access them (in addition to possibly sharing API keys). If you're working individually, I'd still ask you do this for organization's sake for grading.
4. Use git to add, commit, and push your new project to the `main` branch - now you have your starting point set locally and on GitHub! You are now ready to get started.
5. Don't forget to branch before you create commits - you'll need to create Pull Requests for the major project deliverables.
